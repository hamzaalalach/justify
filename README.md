# justify
Made for Tictactip, coding challenge

# RUNNING THE PROJECT
- Install the required dependencies:

  `yarn install`
  
- Running the server:

  `yarn dev` or `yarn start`
 
Decicated port: `5000`

Please note that running with `yarn dev` will lead to active tokens being cleared more often, as they're only stored in memory.
